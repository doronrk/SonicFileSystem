Roadmap:
    - 'capture' sound files

Motivation:
    - Searching for the right sound through a file system tedious and can often impede the creative process.
    - SonicFileSystem is a first pass at creating an interactive, aesthetically pleasing environment for browsing sound files.
    - In order to take advantage of the user's existing familiarity with their file system, the structure of the file system is used to determine the orbits.
    - The environment is also navigable using familiar command line instructions detailed in the user guide.
User guide:
    - Press 'command' to toggle command line mode on and off
    - When in command line mode 
        - 'cd [directory]' navigates to that directory
        - 'cd ..' navigates to the parent directory
        - 'pl [filename]' plays the file
    - When not in command line mode
        - 'd' toggles the display of directory names
        - 's' toggles the display of file names
