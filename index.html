  <title>This is the Sonic File System</title>
  <div>

<br>

<p>Motivation
    <br> - Searching for the right sound through a file system tedious and can often impede the creative process.
    <br> - SonicFileSystem is a first pass at creating an interactive, aesthetically pleasing environment for browsing sound files.
    <br> - In order to take advantage of the user's existing familiarity with their file system, the structure of the file system is used to determine the orbits.
    <br> - The environment is also navigable using familiar command line instructions detailed in the user guide.
</p>

<p>User guide
    <br> - Press 'command' to toggle command line mode on and off
    <br> - When in command line mode 
    <br> &nbsp; - 'cd [directory]' navigates to that directory
    <br> &nbsp; - 'cd ..' navigates to the parent directory
    <br> &nbsp; - 'pl [filename]' plays the file
    <br> - When not in command line mode 
    <br> &nbsp; - 'd' toggles the display of directory names
    <br> &nbsp; - 's' toggles the display of file names
